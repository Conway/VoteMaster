# VoteMaster

VoteMaster is a small application written in Python that manages a vote or election. It features a robust admin interface, as well as a simple to use user interface. 

To get started, modify `config.py` to meet your organization's needs. As long as that is properly configured, all other data can be inputted within the application (options, etc.).

The admin interface can be found by going to `/admin`. All other admin tools can be found there in the sidebar. 

This site isn't perfect, and there are still a few areas that can be fixed or improved, but it works.
